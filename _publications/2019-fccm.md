High-level synthesis (HLS) allows developers to be
more productive in designing FPGA circuits thanks to familiar
programming languages and high-level abstractions. In order
to create high-performance circuits, HLS tools, such as Xilinx
Vivado HLS, require following specific design patterns and techniques.
Unfortunately, when applied to network packet processing
tasks, these techniques limit code reuse and modularity, requiring
developers to use deprecated programming conventions.

We propose a methodology for developing high-speed net-
working applications using Vivado HLS for C++, focusing on
reusability, code simplicity, and overall performance. Following
this methodology, we implement a class library ([`ntl`](https://github.com/acsl-technion/ntl)) with
several building blocks that can be used in a wide spectrum
of networking applications. We evaluate the methodology by
implementing two applications: a UDP stateless firewall and a
key-value store cache designed for FPGA-based SmartNICs, both
processing packets at 40Gbps line-rate.
